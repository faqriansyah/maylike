![shoukd be screenshot of the theme](screenshot.png)
Made with minimum effort and maximum vibes. You may like it, you may not.

MayLike is a theme Born out of mild boredom and just enough motivation

This theme was built while half-lying down, possibly during a procrastination spiral.
It’s not optimized for anything in particular, but somehow it works.

MayLike is a block-based WordPress theme that does just enough to not break.
It supports posts, pages, and your sudden bursts of productivity at 2 AM.
No crazy JS, no frameworks, and probably no regrets.

I didn’t make it for clients. I didn’t make it for performance benchmarks.
I made it because i want to.

So here it is. MayLike.
You may like it. You may not.
